===================================
Conclusion and Learnings
===================================
This course and project have significantly increased my Python developer capabilities all round.
These are my main takeways from this project:

- Regex in C was not easy to implement, but definitely worth the time.

    - This will be a major optimization before my first release.
    - The impact is very large, because every static script generated, uses some regex.

- I will keep myself in check by keeping a Unit Test score of about 80%

    - I also realised implementing tests makes me less worrysome if something will break

- Websockets look very promising and I am planning to swith to sockets later on

    - I am not switching at this moment, because the APIs do their job
    - The full implementation and changes through my existing codebase are huge

- The maintainability of the main repo will also increase a lot since:

    - My git messages are more clear
    - I am branching, when working on different functionalities
    - CI/CD can manage the deployment process as well as testing




Data Fluent's Future Goals
=================================
Getting a first maintainable, testable and optimised release build out, is going to be easier because of everything I learned.
That's why I am certain that my future plans will be achieved with more easy then before. These are my plans

- Intergrate all the changes from this 'Upgrades' repository to the main repository.
- Keep on building until I create my first tagged and released beta build by the end of this summer.
- Find my first company and/or partner which is in need of the system.
- Create a customized version of the tool, tailored to that business.
- Intergration of NLP for easy data analysis and text generation.
